	 "Description":"Male zebra finches were isolated in a sound attenuation chamber and recorded with a single microphone. The birds were reared by a female adult (in the absence of adult males) between days 7–30 post-hatch and then they were singly housed in the chamber. The entire song development was recorded: song activity was automatically detected and continuously saved (sampling frequency 32 kHz) throughout the experiment. From 33–39 day post hatch(dph) until 43 dph birds were passively exposed to 20 playbacks per day of the tutor song, occurring at random with a probability of 0.005 per second. On day 43, each bird was trained to press a key to hear song playbacks, with a daily quota of 20 songs. The recordings also captured the playbacks of tutor songs, we removed these playbacks from the dataset.",
